# MIDI to TEXT #

This is a revival of the programs mf2t and t2mf that I wrote starting in 1991, for the Atari ST (32-bit), MS-DOS (16-bit) and later Unix (probably 32-bits).

I recently picked this up again after some people asked me for executables for modern Windows (presumably 32- or 64-bit). I use a Mac, so I needed newer versions, for 64-bit OS's (in my case MacOS Ventura).

Modern C-compilers are much more picky than the Kernighan & Ritchie C-compilers that I first used. So the source code had to be adjusted to conform to more modern C standards (in this case C-99). The bulk of this work had been done (as far as I know) by Mats Peterson (see below).

I also found a number of changed versions by different people, mainly for compiling on Windows 32-bit (for example Windows-XP, which still runs on Windows 11). I'll try to mention all people who contributed but some contributions were anonymous.

This repository contains as far as possible the history of the source code, but, for example, the Original RCS repository for the source code has been lost, so the history is a crude approximation.

All the text files have been converted to Unix format, using UTF-8 when ASCII isn't sufficient. If you need Windows format, please convert them yourselves.
